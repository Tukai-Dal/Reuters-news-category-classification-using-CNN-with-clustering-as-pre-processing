# The project has a primary focus on two aspects of text classification:
1. Feature Engineering (Primarily involves clustering as a data preprocessing step)
2. Enhancing Feature selection using concept from a recent published paper in a reputed Journal (Maggipinto, M., Masiero, C., Beghi, A., & Susto, G. A. (2018). A Convolutional Autoencoder Approach for Feature Extraction in Virtual Metrology: Paper ID 259. Procedia Manufacturing, 17, 126-133.)
