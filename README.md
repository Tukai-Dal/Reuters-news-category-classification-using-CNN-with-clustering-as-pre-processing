# The project has a primary focus on two aspects of text classification:
1. Feature Engineering 
2. Enhancing Feature selection using concept from a recent published paper in a reputed Journal 
#
For step 1 we primarily focus on Clustering as a data pre-processing step <br />
For step 2 we selected the paper: Maggipinto, M., Masiero, C., Beghi, A., & Susto, G. A. (2018). A Convolutional Autoencoder Approach for Feature Extraction in Virtual Metrology: Paper ID 259. Procedia Manufacturing, 17, 126-133.
