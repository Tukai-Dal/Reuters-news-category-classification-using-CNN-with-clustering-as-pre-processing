# The project has a focus on two important aspects of text classification:
1. Feature Engineering 
2. Enhancing Feature selection using concept from a recent published paper in a reputed Journal 
#
For step 1, we primarily focus on Clustering as a data pre-processing step <br />
For step 2, we generate a set of features for each extracted cluster separately using the concept from selected the paper; Maggipinto, M., Masiero, C., Beghi, A., & Susto, G. A. (2018). A Convolutional Autoencoder Approach for Feature Extraction in Virtual Metrology: Paper ID 259. Procedia Manufacturing, 17, 126-133.
